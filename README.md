# School SaaS MVP

This project contains a minimal Next.js application that demonstrates a basic SaaS platform for local schools in West Bengal.

## Getting Started

Navigate to the project directory, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash

npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.

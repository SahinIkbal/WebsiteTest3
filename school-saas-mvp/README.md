# School SaaS MVP

This project is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution aimed at local schools in West Bengal. It's built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Project Overview

The goal is to provide a simple, easy-to-use platform for schools to manage administrative tasks, for teachers to manage their classes and students, and for students to view their academic progress.

For this MVP, an in-memory data store is being used to simulate database interactions. This allows for rapid development and iteration of core features.

## Features (Planned for MVP)

*   **User Roles:** Admin, Teacher, Student
*   **Authentication:** Secure login for all user roles.
*   **School Administration:**
    *   Manage school details.
    *   Manage teacher accounts.
    *   Manage classes and assign teachers.
    *   Manage student accounts and assign them to classes.
*   **Teacher Portal:**
    *   View assigned classes.
    *   View students in classes.
    *   Take attendance.
    *   Enter grades.
*   **Student Portal:**
    *   View personal profile.
    *   View attendance records.
    *   View grades.

## Tech Stack

*   **Framework:** Next.js (with App Router)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Linting:** ESLint
*   **Data Store (MVP):** In-memory JavaScript objects
